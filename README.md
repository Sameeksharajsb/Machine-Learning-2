# Regression Models, Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

This repository is a hub to store my notes and assignments on the basics of machine learning concepts and modeling from a Machine Learning course 
I took in my MS-CS program at Santa Clara University 

## Topics Covered
**1.**  Multivariate linear regression, K-means clustering

File: <code>HW2.ipynb</code> - a notebook that implements multivariate linear regression and ridge regression models, 
compares K-means with spectral and hierarchical clustering models.

**2.**  Solving LR via Gradient Descent 

File: <code>LR_and_GD.ipynb</code> - a notebook that implments a Logistic Regression (LR) model and illustrates how to solve LR via Gradient Descent (GD).

**3.**  Dimensionality Reduction: PCA vs t-SNE 

File: <code>HW3(Q1)-PCA-TSNE-1.ipynb</code> - a notebook that compares t-SNE with PCA and explains why t-SNE could lead to a better visualization than PCA
